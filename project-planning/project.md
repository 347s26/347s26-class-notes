# Django Backend Development Project

## Assignment Overview
Teams will build a useful backend web application in Django with a functional and attractive frontend. To earn points, teams make "claims" - concrete accomplishments toward their application. All teams must deploy their application to a hosting service to receive a grade.

## Grading Scheme

Each claim is worth a certain number of points. The grading scale is as follows:

| Points    | Letter Grade |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 900-1000  | A            |
| 800-899   | B            |
| 700-799   | C            |
| 600-699   | D            |
| Below 600 | F            |

In addition, the following requirements must be met for a letter grade:
- Application must be deployed and accessible via URL to receive a D or higher.
- A deployed application with only partial Basic Claims implemented will receive a D (650).
- Application must implement all Basic Claims to receive a C or higher (700).
- Application must implement all Basic and eight Intermediate Claims to receive a B or higher (800).
- Application must implement all Basic, eight Intermediate, and one Stretch Claim to receive an A (900).

Each extra Intermediate Claim beyond the required eight adds 10 points. A second Stretch claim adds 50 points. No more that two Stretch claims can be counted. A team's score is capped at 1000 points.

## Three-Person Teams

Teams of three students face slightly higher requirements:
- Application must be deployed and accessible via URL to receive a D or higher.
- A deployed application with only partial Basic Claims implemented will receive a D (650).
- Application must implement all Basic Claims to receive a C or higher (700).
- Application must implement all Basic and ten Intermediate Claims to receive a B or higher (800).
- Application must implement all Basic, ten Intermediate, and two Stretch Claims to receive an A (900).

Each extra Intermediate Claim beyond the required ten adds 10 points. A third Stretch claim adds 50 points. No more that three Stretch claims can be counted. A team's score is capped at 1000 points.

## When to Make Claims

A claim should be made when the feature is fully implemented and tested. Claims can be made at any time during the project, but it is recommended to make claims as soon as possible to ensure they are evaluated before the project deadline.

Claims may generally be made at two times:
1. **During a lab or work session**: Ask the instructor to evaluate your claim. He will check the feature and, if it meets the requirements, mark it as completed and award points.
2. **In office hours**: If you are unable to make a claim during a lab or work session, you can visit the instructor during office hours to have your claim evaluated.

Note: **No more than three non-Basic claims can be made in a week.** Plan accordingly. Claims cannot be made once final exam week begins.

Claims marked with an asterisk (*) indicate that the claim should be evaluated at the end of the project, not during development.
